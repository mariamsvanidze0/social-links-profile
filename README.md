### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

 learned how to use Flexbox for centering, apply media queries for responsive design, and include custom fonts with @font-face. I also explored hover effects and maintained spacing with gap and padding to structure the layout effectively.


### Continued development

I want to focus on improving my responsive design skills, especially with more complex layouts. I'll also work on refining my knowledge of Flexbox and CSS Grid for better layout control. Additionally, I plan to explore more advanced hover and animation effects to enhance user interactivity.
